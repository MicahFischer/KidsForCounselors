            <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
            <h2>Kids For Counselors is a student organization driven by student led initiatives. Kids For Counselors’
                mission is to provide counselor’s across the United States with the support and resources that they need
                to guide students towards a successful and bright future. As of current we are focusing our efforts
                towards the state of Arizona where the student to counselor ratio is the highest in the nation. Every
                counselor in the state is responsible for an average of 905 students. The figure is up from 903 just two
                years ago. With counselors overwhelmed with students it can be difficult to provide students with the
                proper guidance they need to thrive.</h2>

                <h1>Why Support School Counselors</h1>
                <p>Our school counselors do so much to support out students. However counselors overwhelming prevent
                    them from helping students. With more counselors and greater resources counselors will be able to
                    help when a student:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>has a issue at home</li>
                    <li>needs guidance applying to colleges</li>
                    <li>needs guidance choosing classes</li>
                    <li>needs advice regarding a personal</li>
                    <li>has a issue at school</li>
                    <li>needs guidance towards their academic success</li>

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <h2>Our mission is to provide students resources for higher education and to promote the welfare of
                students. Arizona’s counselors are a major part of the effort to guide students. However Arizona’s
                student to counselor ratio is currently at 905:1, the worst in the nation. Arizona’s ration is almost
                four times the recommended ratio of 250:1. The current situation is only growing worse. Over the last
                two years the ratio has increased from 903:1 to 905:1. The growing crisis put tremendous pressure on
                school counselors to support and guide students with little to no resources and support. The Counselor’s
                Network is a support group designed to provide free resources to counselors to help them provide
                students with the guidance they need and deserve. Our free resources can help students find a career
                they will be passionate about so they can have a successful future to look forward to.</h2>
