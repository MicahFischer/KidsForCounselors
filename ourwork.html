                <h1>What Is Our Mission?</h1>
                <p>Our mission is to provide students resources for higher education and to promote the welfare of students. Arizona’s counselors are a major part of the effort to guide students. However Arizona’s student to counselor ratio is currently at 905:1, the worst in the nation. Arizona’s ration is almost four times the recommended ratio of 250:1. The current situation is only growing worse. Over the last two years the ratio has increased from 903:1 to 905:1. The growing crisis put tremendous pressure on school counselors to support and guide students with little to no resources and support. The Counselor’s Network is a support group designed to provide free resources to counselors to help them provide students with the guidance they need and deserve. Our free resources can help students find a career they will be passionate about so they can have a successful future to look forward to. With help from people like you we can help give more students opportunities for success.</p>
