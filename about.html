                <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
                <h2>Kids For Counselors is a student organization driven by student led initiatives. Kids For Counselors’
                    mission is to provide counselor’s across the United States with the support and resources that they need
                    to guide students towards a successful and bright future. As of current we are focusing our efforts
                    towards the state of Arizona where the student to counselor ratio is the highest in the nation. Every
                    counselor in the state is responsible for an average of 905 students. The figure is up from 903 just two
                    years ago. With counselors overwhelmed with students it can be difficult to provide students with the
                    proper guidance they need to thrive.</h2>

                    <h1>What Is Our Mission?</h1>
                    <p>Our mission is to provide students resources for higher education and to promote the welfare of students. Arizona’s counselors are a major part of the effort to guide students. However Arizona’s student to counselor ratio is currently at 905:1, the worst in the nation. Arizona’s ration is almost four times the recommended ratio of 250:1. The current situation is only growing worse. Over the last two years the ratio has increased from 903:1 to 905:1. The growing crisis put tremendous pressure on school counselors to support and guide students with little to no resources and support. The Counselor’s Network is a support group designed to provide free resources to counselors to help them provide students with the guidance they need and deserve. Our free resources can help students find a career they will be passionate about so they can have a successful future to look forward to. With help from people like you we can help give more students opportunities for success.</p>
